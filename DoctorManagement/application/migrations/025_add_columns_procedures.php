Your surgeon will begin by making small incisions along the natural crease of the upper eye lid (approximately 1cm above the lash line). He or she will then very carefully separate the skin from the underlying tissue before removing or repositioning the fatty tissue and tightening the muscles. Before stitching or gluing the incision using surgical glue, the skin will be stretched to ensure that the end result is smooth and free from lines and wrinkles.\r\rLOWER EYELID SURGERY\rIf you opt for lower eyelid surgery, or a combination of upper and lower eyelid surgery, this will almost always be performed under general anaesthetic. Your surgeon will make an incision along the lower lash line before removing any excess fat (often known as eye bags) and stretching the skin to ensure a smooth finish. Once the incision has been stitched, any excess skin will be removed and you will be left with smoother, younger looking skin underneath the eyes."),

It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.\rIf you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.\rSome self-help techniques may also be useful:\rDo not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse.\rWash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.\rDon\'t try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring.\rAvoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin).\rCompletely remove make-up before going to bed.\rIf dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient.\rRegular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne.\rWash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face.\rTreatments can take up to three months to work, so don\'t expect results overnight.\rSee your GP if your acne is more widespread Р for example, you have a large number of papules and pustules, or over-the-counter medication hasn\'t worked Р as you probably need prescription medication.\rPrescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:\rtopical retinoids\rtopical antibiotics\razelaic acid\rantibiotic tablets\rin women, the combined oral contraceptive pill\risotretinoin tablets\rIf you have severe acne, such as a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back as well as your face, or if you have painful nodules, your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist).\rA combination of antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn\'t work, a medication called isotretinoin may be prescribed.\rHormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the progestogen-only pill or contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse.\rMany of these treatments can take two to three months before they start to work. It\'s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if there is no immediate effect.\rTopical treatments (gels, creams and lotions)\rBenzoyl peroxide\rBenzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads and has an anti-inflammatory effect.\rBenzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It\'s used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.\rIt should be used sparingly as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.\rBenzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes.\rCommon side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:\rdry and tense skin\ra burning, itching or stinging sensation\rsome redness and peeling of the skin\rSide effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.\rMost people need a six-week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.\rTopical retinoids\rTopical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating) which helps prevent them building up within hair follicles.\rTretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They are available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.\rApply to all of the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.\rIt is important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.\rTopical retinoids are not suitable for use during pregnancy as there is a risk that they might cause birth defects.\rThe most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.\rA six-week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.\rTopical antibiotics\rTopical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They are available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.\rA six- to eight-week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped as there is a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.\rSide effects are uncommon, but can include:\rminor irritation of the skin\rredness and burning of the skin\rpeeling of the skin\rAzelaic acid\rAzelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.\rAzelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It is available as a cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).\rThe medication does not make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you do not have to avoid exposure to the sun.\rYou will usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.\rThe side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:\rburning or stinging skin\ritchiness\rdry skin\rredness of the skin\rAntibiotic tablets\rAntibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.\rIn most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\rPregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.\rIt will usually take about six weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.\rDepending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last four to six months.\rTetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.\rYou will need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time.\rHormonal therapies\rHormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.\rIf you don\'t already use it, your GP may recommend that you start taking the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you are not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.\rCo-cyprindiol\rCo-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne that doesn\'t respond to antibiotics. It helps reduce the production of sebum.\rYou will probably have to use co-cyprindiol for two to six months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.\rThere is a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life.\rFor example, out of a group of 10,000 women who have not taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least five years in their early twenties.\rThere is also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk is estimated to be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.\rIt is not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.\rOther side effects of co-cyprindiol include:\rbleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months\rheadaches\rsore breasts\rmood changes\rloss of interest in sex\rweight gain or weight loss\rIsotretinoin\rIsotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects:\rit helps normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced\rit helps prevent follicles becoming clogged\rit decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin\rit reduces redness and swelling in and around spots\rHowever, the drug can also cause a wide range of side effects. It is therefore only recommended for severe cases of acne that have not responded to other treatments.\rBecause of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a dermatologist.\rIsotretinoin is taken as a tablet. Most people take a four- to six-month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.\rCommon side effects of isotretinoin include:\rinflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils\rchanges in your blood sugar levels\rinflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)\rinflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)\rblood in your urine\rRarer side effects of isotretinoin include:\rinflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\rinflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\rkidney disease\rRead more about the side effects of isotretinoin.\rBecause of the risk of these rarer side effects, you will need a blood test before and during treatment.\rIsotretinoin and birth defects\rIsotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you\'re a woman of childbearing age:\rdon\'t use isotretinoin if you are pregnant or you think you are pregnant\ruse one, or ideally two, methods of contraception for one month before treatment begins, during treatment and for one month after treatment has finished\rhave a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment\rYou will be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you are not currently sexually active.\rIf you think you may have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.\rIsotretinoin is also not suitable if you are breastfeeding.\rIsotretinoin and mood changes\rThere have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There is no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.\rHowever, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.\rNon-pharmaceutical treatments\rSeveral treatments for acne do not involve medication.\rThese include:\rcomedone extractor Р a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads\rchemical peels Р where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it\rphotodynamic therapy Р where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne\rThese treatments may not work and can therefore not be routinely recommended."),
