VoyagerMed does not provide medical or health advice but offers information on practicing physicians and other healthcare providers. VoyagerMed organizes key information to help patients make informed choices in their search to independently assess particular physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals, insurers and other providers of healthcare services and persons working on their behalves (collectively, “Healthcare Providers”). The information is free of charge and is offered to the public for its non-commercial use.
				To enable such assessment, VoyagerMed includes profiles, objective and subjective ratings, feedback, comments, indexes, scorecards, materials and other informative details about the Healthcare Providers. The information used to drive VoyagerMed is compiled from a variety of sources, including independent surveys, publicly available records, VoyagerMed account registrants and third-party providers, then processed using various empirical algorithms, and finally arranged in a non-complicated, simple-to-use and easy-to-view arrangement.
				The following Terms of Use are a User Agreement that governs Your access to and use of VoyagerMed, including the profiles, objective and subjective ratings, feedback, comments, indexes, scorecards, materials and other informative details about the Healthcare Providers and any other content (collectively, the “Content”) and all of the products and services (collectively, the “Products and Services”) offered by VoyagerMed available on or through VoyagerMed. The words “User,” “You” and “Your” as used in this agreement refer to users of VoyagerMed, including, without limitation, Healthcare Providers who access VoyagerMed to edit any Content related to them and users who post ratings, reviews and/or comments about Healthcare Providers.";
